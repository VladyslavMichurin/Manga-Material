# Manga-Material
This is a material that aims to make 3d objects look as if they were drawn in manga style. The shader uses lambertian diffuse for light and divides it in 3 sections: highlights, base color and shadows. Each section can be remaped to a specific color and you can regulate it's size. For shadows you can choose a texture that will be applied to that region, it rotates based on light direction and has several modes to determine how it should do it(you can change mode in shader).
